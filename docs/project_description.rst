Description of project
======================

Orange County Lettings is a start-up in the property rental sector. As a developer, I am expected
to play an important role in improving the company's site, both in terms of code and deployment.

We began by refactoring our Django project, streamlining its structure to enhance performance and
maintainability. Next, we migrated the database seamlessly using Django's built-in migration tools,
ensuring data integrity throughout the update. After Dockerizing the project into a container, we
hosted the image on Docker Hub for centralized access and version control. Utilizing GitHub
Actions, we established a streamlined pipeline that automatically builds, tests, and deploys the
Docker image upon each commit to our main branch. Finally, leveraging Render's platform, we
deployed our Dockerized Django application, taking advantage of its scalability and robust
deployment capabilities.

This integrated approach has not only optimized our development workflow but also strengthened our
ability to deliver updates efficiently while maintaining the reliability of our application
infrastructure.
